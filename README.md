# To-Do-List

This is a basic To-Do List using Python's Tkinter module. It is an interactive GUI where you can create lists, and then fill them with data. The data saves into the save.txt file. This means that upon rerunning the application, your data will still be saved.


## How to Use
To start, you can click on "New List" to create a new list. The top text will is the list's title. The bottom text field above the submit button will act as the list data entry form. To add data to the list, type in the bottom text field and then press submit. If you wish to save your list, press the save button. Click on the back button at the top left
corner to go back to the previous screen. To load a saved list, click on Lists. This will open saved lists. Click on the list you saved, then click on Load. This will load your list. You can do all the aforementioned here as well. To delete items in the list, click on the item you wish to delete, then press the Delete button on the bottom left. If you wish to reload the deleted data, then press on Save. Note: If you want to delete the data permanently, click delete and then DO NOT click on save. Upon leaving the application the data will be deleted permanently.
